# agile-final-project
back-end product catalog for an e-commerce website

In this scenario, you will play the roles of a product owner, scrum master, and developer. As a product owner, you will create stories for your team and organize these stories into a product backlog. As a scrum master, you will create a sprint milestone and ensure that a subset of the stories is ready to be placed in a sprint plan. As a developer, you will create the sprint backlog and execute some of the stories by moving them across the kanban board in a simulated sprint.

Your team has been tasked with developing the back-end product catalog for an e-commerce website. Stakeholders require the ability to create, retrieve, update, and delete products from the catalog, along with features like indicating product likes and hosting on a cloud environment with automated deployments.

Your team will use a kanban board to create a backlog and sprint plan for this work. As the product owner, you will drive the process by leveraging the skills learned in the lessons and labs to create a new GitHub repository and kanban board and fill the kanban board with issues that will become user stories.
